# No Longer supported

After putting work into this a couple years back, I realized it was not an approach I wanted to keep using.

## Why?

* I added too much. A lot of plugins are simple and there is no need to over think it all.
* It basically added a new API that needed to be learned to use it.
  * That is one of the reasons I have shoed away from theme frameworks.
  * Each time I went back to it, I forgot how to use it myself.

## So What Now?

I decided a better approach was something like the Plugin Boilerplate, by Tom McFarlin. However, I never did use that because there were some things I did not like about it. 

So I made my own. I have used it to create plugin super fast and find it incredibly easy to take out whay I don't need and add new features when I need more.
